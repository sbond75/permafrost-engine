# This file is transmogrified into Setup.config by config.status.

# For the Permafrost Engine embedded Python interpreter, we don't 
# want any OS/platform specific stuff - comment it all out

# The purpose of this file is to conditionally enable certain modules
# based on configure-time options.

# init system calls(posix/nt/...) for INITFUNC (used by makesetup)
#posix posixmodule.c

# This is needed to find out the user's home dir if $HOME is not set
#pwd pwdmodule.c

# Threading
#thread threadmodule.c

# The signal module
#signal signalmodule.c

# build-in modules for windows platform:
##_winreg ../PC/_winreg.c
##_functools _functoolsmodule.c	# Tools for working with functions and callable objects
##operator operator.c	# operator.add() and similar goodies
##_locale _localemodule.c	# -lintl
##time timemodule.c
##msvcrt ../PC/msvcrtmodule.c

# The rest of the modules previously listed in this file are built
# by the setup.py script in Python 2.1 and later.
